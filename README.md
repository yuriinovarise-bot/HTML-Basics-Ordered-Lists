# HTML Basics – Ordered Lists

This project contains an exercise about creating ordered lists (`<ol>`) in HTML.

## Task №1

Besides unordered lists, there are also **ordered lists**. In ordered lists, each item is numbered instead of using bullet points.  

Ordered lists are created using the `<ol>` tag, and each list item is wrapped in a `<li>` tag.  

The advantage of ordered lists is that if you insert a new item anywhere in the list, the numbering automatically updates — you don’t have to adjust it manually.

### Example:
```html
<ol>
    <li>text</li>
    <li>text</li>
    <li>text</li>
    <li>text</li>
    <li>text</li>
</ol>
